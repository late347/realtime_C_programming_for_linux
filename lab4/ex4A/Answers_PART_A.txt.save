answers for ex4A

part1 

a) when fflush(stdout) is done before return 0; then I think that
incomplete buffer will be outputted if there was less than the 5 chars
But ifthere was only return 0, and no fflush, then the incomplete
 5 chars will not be printed

b) with exit(0) only there was compiler warning 
warning: implicit declaration of function ‘exit’
 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

otherwise, the incomplete buf was still printed out at least for me
(my sample input had been aaaaabbbbbcccccddddd\n) 


c) with the only return 0; and not using exit(0) or fflush(stdout)
then the incomplete buffer was not printed out at program ending.
This may have been such that the main exits, with closing down 
the streams that were open, but without flushing
