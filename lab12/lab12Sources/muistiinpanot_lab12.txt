*mainthread
- waits until all subthreads are done working
-displays value of common counter, I think...
-




*each subthread 
-increments the commoncounter 1 000 000 times
- there is counterArray which is in scope of main funciton,
- subthread incremets their own "counter" inside counerArray


*what is problem?
-probably the problem is read-modify-write cycle for threads, when accessing commonCounter globalVAr
-increment is not normally atomic
-so context switching fucks it up
-mutex can be used to protect the commoncounter before increments are done
into common counter
-expected results would be that always the localcounters are correct amounts
-expected results for commoncounter in phase1 is that it loses increments (commonIncr < subThreadAmount*incrAmount)
-expected results for mutexprotected commoncounter in phase2 is that increments are correct (commonIncr == subThreadAmount * incrAmount)
