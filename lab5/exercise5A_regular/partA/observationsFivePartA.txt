NOTES!!!
	after running the program multiple times
	it appears that initially all the childprocesses printed sequentially
	such as ABCDE

	but afterwards usually the printouts became totally jumbled up
	so they were mixed

	also there was no guarantee that the child procesess would terminate
	in sequential order either, sometiems the first started child
	didnt stop first as would be perhaps intuitively expected

	probbably this happened because of linux scheduling
