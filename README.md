# realtime_C_programming_for_linux

-contains labs for systems - programming in C, for linux

-we didn't go too far into the real-time-systems design in this course, but we had some basic concepts

-we mostly had soft real-time systems

-executable files were mostly compiled for Ubuntu  18.04 LTS, some exercises had obj files which had to be linked (which were also included in the folders)
